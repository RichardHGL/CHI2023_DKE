## Introduction
Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to find the answer entities that are multiple hops away in the Knowledge Base (KB) from the entities in the question. A major challenge is the lack of supervision signals at intermediate steps. Therefore, multi-hop KBQA algorithms can only receive the feedback from the final answer, which makes the learning unstable or ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a novel teacher-student approach for the multi-hop KBQA task.
