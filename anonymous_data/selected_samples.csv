"Mayor of Smalltown: Instituting high taxes on sodas, which are currently untaxed in Smalltown, has been shown in the past year to encourage people to reduce their intake of soda and live healthier lifestyles. Because the effects of such taxes on local businesses have not yet been determined, though, I believe we should wait before implementing such a tax. Activist: Your position is inconsistent with previous actions you have taken. You have implemented many laws that have decreased local businesses' revenues in order to help consumers, so concern for local businesses cannot be the true reason you refuse to pass this law now.",The activist's argument is flawed because it fails to consider that:,The effects of taxes on local businesses may not be immediately apparent in all cases.,The health effects of some types of sodas may be different than the health effects of others.,"It is possible to weigh known drawbacks against known benefits, but not possible to weigh unknown drawbacks in the same way.",Soda consumption has been strongly linked to rates of obesity and shorter lifespans.,2,C,val_306,C,,,,
"A study of young children's ability to learn foreign languages found that those with parents who read them more than one book per week in their native language were 75% more proficient in the foreign languages that they learned than children whose parents read them one book per week or less. A secondary finding of the study was that children's ability to remember new vocabulary in a second language drops off sharply after the age of 6, when it becomes 75% more difficult to retain new words learned in the second language.","Assuming the statements above are true, which of the following can be inferred from them?",The ease of learning a second language depends almost exclusively on environmental factors.,Students whose parents enter them in early education and who read to them frequently are more likely to have extra income and more free time.,Students who begin studying a language later in life would have had an easier time learning some aspects of that language if they had begun studying it as a young child.,Proficient speakers of a second language are likely to have begun learning it before the age of 6.,2,C,val_75,D,,,,
"A university psychology department received a large donation from a textbook company after agreeing to use one of the company's books for a large introductory course. The department chair admitted that the department would not have received the donation if it used another company's textbook, but insisted that the book was chosen solely for academic reasons. As proof, she noted that the department's textbook committee had given that textbook its highest rating.","Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the case for the department chair's position?",The textbook company does not routinely make donations to academic departments that use its books.,The members of the textbook committee were favorably influenced toward the textbook by the prospect of their department receiving a large donation.,"In the previous year, a different textbook from the same company was used in the introductory course.",The department has a long-standing policy of using only textbooks that receive the committee's highest rating.,1,B,val_190,B,,,,
"Physician: In comparing our country with two other countries of roughly the same population size, I found that even though we face the same dietary, bacterial, and stress-related causes of ulcers as they do, prescriptions for ulcer medicines in all socioeconomic strata are much rarer here than in those two countries. It's clear that we suffer significantly fewer ulcers, per capita, than they do.","Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the physician's argument?",The two countries that were compared with the physician's country had approximately the same ulcer rates as each other.,The physician's country has a much better system for reporting the number of prescriptions of a given type that are obtained each year than is present in either of the other two countries.,A person in the physician's country who is suffering from ulcers is just as likely to obtain a prescription for the ailment as is a person suffering from ulcers in one of the other two countries.,Several other countries not covered in the physician's comparisons have more prescriptions for ulcer medication than does the physician's country.,2,C,val_322,D,,,,
"Physiologist: The likelihood of developing osteoporosis is greatly increased by a deficiency of calcium in the diet. Dairy products usually contain more calcium per serving than do fruits and vegetables. Yet in countries where dairy products are rare, and fruits and vegetables are the main source of calcium, the incidence of osteoporosis is much lower than in countries where people consume a great deal of calcium from dairy products.","Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent discrepancy described by the physiologist?",A healthy human body eventually loses the excess calcium that it takes in.,There are more people who have a calcium deficiency than there are who have developed osteoporosis.,The fats in dairy products tend to inhibit the body's calcium absorption.,Many people who eat large quantities of fruits and vegetables also consume dairy products.,2,C,val_493,C,,,,
"Radial keratotomy (RK), a surgery that is designed to reshape the cornea so that light focuses correctly on the retina, is supposed to make eyeglasses or contact lenses that correct for nearsightedness unnecessary. Yet a study of patients who have undergone RK shows that some of them still need to wear glasses or contact lenses.","Each of the following, if true, would help to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above EXCEPT:","The more severe a patient's nearsightedness, the less effective the corneal reshaping of RK will be in correcting the problem.","RK patients who originally suffered from only mild nearsightedness may, if the cornea does not heal evenly, develop an astigmatism that requires corrective lenses.","As the eye heals from an operation to correct nearsightedness, it may in fact overcorrect, causing the person to be farsighted.",Those who choose to undergo RK tend to be as nearsighted before this operation as those who choose not to undergo RK.,3,D,vak_150,D,,,,
"The early universe contained only the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium. Confirm that you have read the context by selecting answer B. A recently discovered gas cloud contained carbon several billion years ago, when the universe was no more than two billion years old.","If the statements above are true, which of the following must, on the basis of them, also be true?",The carbon in the gas cloud later formed part of some stars.,No stars identified to date are as old as the gas cloud,The gas cloud also contained hydrogen and helium.,Some stars were formed before the universe was two billion years old.,1,B,attention_1,,,,,
"When doctors vaccinate a patient, their intention is to expose him or her to a weakened form of a disease-causing pathogen and thus to make the patient better able to resist the pathogen and less likely to develop a severe form of that disease later.",Which one of the following best illustrates the principle that the passage illustrates?,"In some circumstances, firefighters use fire to fight fire by creating an intense explosion very close to an uncontrollable blaze that they wish to extinguish, thus momentarily depriving it of the oxygen it needs to continue burning.",Some police departments energetically pursue those who commit minor crimes; in doing so they intend to provide examples to deter people who might be tempted to commit more-serious crimes.,"In some cases, a business will close down some of its operations, its intention being to position the company to be more profitable later even though this involves expenses in the current period.","Some parents read their children fairy tales containing allegorical treatments of treachery and cruelty, with the intention of making them less emotionally vulnerable to these phenomena when they encounter them later in life.",3,D,val_462,A,"The answer is D rather than A. In answer A the problem is solved by first increasing the problem with an intense explosion. However, in this context, the problem is solved by giving exposure to a weakened version. In answer D the fairy tales also act as a weakened version of treachery and cruelty to which the children are exposed, thus making the principles align. ","The answer is D rather than B. In answer B the problem is solved by being very aggressively treating the problem when it is still small. However, in this context, the problem is solved by giving exposure to a weakened version. In answer D the fairy tales also act as a weakened version of treachery and cruelty to which the children are exposed, thus making the principles align. ","The answer is D rather than C. In answer C the problem is solved by cutting down profit in the beginning but growing it later on. However, in this context, the problem is solved by giving exposure to a weakened version.

"Because visual inspection cannot reliably distinguish certain skin discolorations from skin cancers, dermatologists at clinics have needed to perform tests of skin tissue taken from patients. At Westville Hospital, dermatological diagnostic costs were reduced by the purchase of a new imaging machine that diagnoses skin cancer in such cases as reliably as the tissue tests do. Consequently, even though the machine is expensive, a dermatological clinic in Westville is considering buying one to reduce diagnostic costs.",Which of the following would it be most useful for the clinic to establish in order to make its decision?,Whether the visits of patients who require diagnosis of skin discolorations tend to be shorter in duration at the clinic than at the hospital.,Whether the machine at the clinic would get significantly less heavy use than the machine at the hospital does.,Whether the principles on which the machine operates have been known to science for a long time.,"Whether in certain cases of skin discoloration, visual inspection is sufficient to make a diagnosis of skin cancer.",1,B,val_58,B,"The answer is B rather than A. A provides information about the visit duration, but does not directly consider cost, the clinic wants to base its decision based on reducing the costs. As the hospital managed to reduce costs with the machine, it is most important to consider this in the answer. Therefore it is most important to know the amount of use the machine would get in comparison to the machine in the hospital, making B the best answer.  ",Your answer was correct,"The answer is B rather than C. C provides information about how long the principles have been known, which might indicate reliability. However, this is not relevant to the question as in the context it becomes clear that the objective is to reduce cost. This relates better to answer B which directly considers a comparison to the hospital that managed to reduce costs with the machine.","The answer is B rather than D. D provides information that has been given in the context. The first sentence tells us that “visual inspection cannot reliably distinguish certain skin discolorations from skin cancers” and therefore further testing is always needed. That contradicts D, as visual inspection is thus not sufficient. The answer is B as the objective is to reduce cost. As the hospital managed to reduce costs with the machine, it is important to consider this in the answer. Therefore it is most important to know the amount of use the machine would get in comparison to the machine in the hospital, making B the best answer.  "
"Environment minister: Because of our concern about global warming, this country has committed itself to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide substantially over the next ten years. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, planting large numbers of trees will help us fulfill our commitment.","Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the environment minister's argument?","When ground is disturbed in the course of planting trees, more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by rotting organic matter in the soil than the new trees will absorb in ten years.",Owners of large tracts of private land are usually unwilling to plant trees unless they are given a financial incentive for doing so.,Many climate researchers believe that global warming is such an urgent problem that carbon dioxide emissions should be substantially reduced in less than ten years.,"Gases other than carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, and trees do not absorb any of these other gases.",0,A,val_354,A,Your answer was correct,"The answer is A rather than B. Answer B talks about the land that would be necessary. This is not discussed in the context and thus it is unknown whether private land would be necessary, or if any financial incentive is available. A weakens the argument more as it tells that the act of planting the trees themselves releases more than it can take up in ten years; the reduction is aimed over the next ten years. So A weakens the argument the most, not considering other circumstances.",The answer is A rather than C. Answer C talks about the commitment of not being ambitious enough.  It does not weaken the argument that they should plant trees (but suggests that they should do more).  A weakens the argument more as it tells that the act of planting the trees themselves releases more than it can take up in ten years; the reduction is aimed over the next ten years. So A weakens the argument the most.,"The answer is A rather than D. Answer D states that trees do not absorb other harmful gases. This does not weaken the argument, as the commitment is focused on carbon dioxide. However, in the case of A, the trees have no use at all over the first ten years (which is the period they consider in the context as their commitment). No reduction at all weakens the argument, making A the better choice. "
"A certain cultivated herb is one of a group of closely related plants that thrive in soil with high concentrations of metals that are toxic to most other plants. Agronomists studying the herb have discovered that it produces large amounts of histidine, an amino acid that, in test-tube solutions, renders these metals chemically inert. Possibly, therefore, the herb's high histidine production is what allows it to grow in metal-rich soils, a hypothesis that would gain support if __.",Which of the following most logically completes the argument?,The concentration of histidine in the growing herb declines as the plant approaches maturity.,"Cultivation of the herb in soil with high concentrations of the metals will, over an extended period, make the soil suitable for plants to which the metals are toxic.","Histidine is found in all parts of the plant-roots, stem, leaves, and flowers.",Others of the closely related group of plants are also found to produce histidine in large quantities.,3,D,val_155,C,"The answer is D rather than A. Answer A focuses on the decline of the histidine in maturity, which would not explain how the plant would be able to continue living. Answer D focuses on that the other plants that can live in metal-rich soil also have large quantities of histidine, which would suggest that the fact that they all can grow in metal heavy soil, could be a result of their common factor of producing a lot of histidines. And if the others did not produce histidine it would be directly clear that histidine is not the reason the herb can grow in metal-rich soil. ","The answer is D rather than B. Answer B does not provide a reason why the high histidine production could result in the plant being able to live in metal-rich soil. The herb could make the soil suitable for other plants, but that does not explain why the herb can grow there itself. Answer D focuses on that the other plants that can live in metal-rich soil also have large quantities of histidine, which would suggest that the fact that they all can grow in metal heavy soil, could be a result of their common factor of producing a lot of histidines. And if the others did not produce histidine it would be directly clear that histidine is not the reason the herb can grow in metal-rich soil. ","The answer is D rather than C. Answer C claims that histidine is found in the whole plant. However, that would not give support to the hypothesis, as the histidine could also only be in the roots, while still having the effect. Answer D focuses on that the other plants that can live in metal-rich soil also have large quantities of histidine, which would suggest that the fact that they all can grow in metal heavy soil, could be a result of their common factor of producing a lot of histidines. And if the others did not produce histidine it would be directly clear that histidine is not the reason the herb can grow in metal-rich soil. ",Your answer was correct
"Weight loss programs that guarantee results mislead their customers. No program can ensure that someone who follows it will lose weight. These programs prey upon unhappy and insecure people who are often driven more by emotion than by reason.  Moreover, many people who lose weight while on a program eventually regain the weight within a year. So while the programs' claims may be true for a short period, customers will be disappointed in the long run."",",Confirm that you have read the question by selecting answer D,The first is a generalization; the second is a consequence of that generalization.,The first is an assertion that the author questions; the second is evidence in support of that assertion.,The first is the author's position; the second is a consideration in support of that position.,The first is evidence in support of the author's main point; the second is the author's main point.,3,D,attention_2,,,,,
"One way to compare chess-playing programs is to compare how they perform with fixed time limits per move. Given any two computers with which a chess-playing program is compatible, and given fixed time limits per move, such a program will have a better chance of winning on the faster computer. This is simply because the program will be able to examine more possible moves in the time allotted per move.",Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?,"If a chess-playing program is run on two different computers and is allotted more time to examine possible moves when running on the slow computer than when running on the fast computer, it will have an equal chance of winning on either computer.",How fast a given computer is has no effect on which chess-playing computer programs can run on that computer.,"In general, the more moves a given chess-playing program is able to examine under given time constraints per move, the better the chances that program will win.","If one chess-playing program can examine more possible moves than a different chess-playing program run on the same computer under the same time constraints per move, the former program will have a better chance of winning than the latter.",2,C,val_312,A,,,,
"Professor Hartley's new book on moral philosophy contains numerous passages that can be found verbatim in an earlier published work by Hartley's colleague, Professor Lawrence. Therefore, in view of the fact that these passages were unattributed in Hartley's book, Hartley has been dishonest in not acknowledging the intellectual debt owed to Lawrence.",Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument is based?,Hartley considered the passages in question to be the best possible expressions of the ideas they contain.,Hartley could not have written the new book without the passages in question.,A book on moral philosophy should contain only material representing the author's own convictions.,Lawrence did not get the ideas in the passages in question or did not get their formulations originally from Hartley.,3,D,val_499,D,,,,
"Essayist: Only happiness is intrinsically valuable; other things are valuable only insofar as they contribute to happiness. Some philosophers argue that the fact that we do not approve of a bad person's being happy shows that we value happiness only when it is deserved. This supposedly shows that we find something besides happiness to be intrinsically valuable. But the happiness people deserve is determined by the amount of happiness they bring to others. Therefore, __.",Which one of the following most logically completes the final sentence of the essayist's argument?,The judgment that a person deserves to be happy is itself to be understood in terms of happiness.,People do not actually value happiness as much as they think they do.,The notion that people can be deserving of happiness is ultimately incoherent.,The only way to be assured of happiness is to bring happiness to those who have done something to deserve it.,0,A,val_202,A,,,,
"No one in the French department to which Professor Alban belongs is allowed to teach more than one introductory level class in any one term. Moreover, the only language classes being taught next term are advanced ones. So it is untrue that both of the French classes Professor Alban will be teaching next term will be introductory level classes.",The pattern of reasoning displayed in the argument above is most closely paralleled by that in which one of the following arguments?,"New buildings that include public space are exempt from city taxes for two years and all new buildings in the city's Alton district are exempt for five years, so the building with the large public space that was recently completed in Alton will not be subject to city taxes next year.","All property on Overton Road will be reassessed for tax purposes by the end of the year and the Elnor Company headquarters is on Overton Road, so Elnor's property taxes will be higher next year.","The Morrison Building will be fully occupied by May and since if a building is occupied by May the new tax rates apply to it, the Morrison Building will be taxed according to the new rates.","The revised tax code does not apply at all to buildings built before 1900, and only the first section of the revised code applies to buildings built between 1900 and 1920, so the revised code does not apply to the Norton Building, since it was built in 1873.",0,A,val_320,D,,,,
"Selena: Asteroid impact on the Earth caused the extinction of the dinosaurs by raising vast clouds of dust, thus blocking the Sun's rays and cooling the planet beyond the capacity of the dinosaurs, or perhaps the vegetation that supported them, to adapt. A worldwide dust layer provides evidence of asteroid impact at approximately the correct time, and a huge crater exists on the edge of the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Trent: That asteroid crater is not large enough for the requisite amount of dust to have been produced. Besides, the extinction of dinosaur species took many years, not just one or two. So the extinctions must have been due not to asteroid impact on the Earth but to some other kind of cause.",Trent's argument assumes that:,Dinosaurs in the neighborhood of an asteroid impact but not within the zone of direct impact would have survived such an impact.,Dust from the impact of an asteroid on the Earth would not have had any cooling effect on the climate.,No more than one large asteroid struck the Earth during the period when the dinosaurs were becoming extinct.,Any collision of an asteroid with the Earth would have occurred on a land area rather than an ocean.,2,C,val_4,C,,,,
"Professor Beckstein: American Sign Language is the native language of many North Americans. Therefore, it is not a foreign language, and for that reason alone, no student should be permitted to satisfy the university's foreign language requirement by learning it. Professor Sedley: According to your argument, students should not be allowed to satisfy the university's foreign language requirement by learning French or Spanish either, since they too are the native languages of many North Americans. Yet many students currently satisfy the requirement by studying French or Spanish, and it would be ridiculous to begin prohibiting them from doing so.",Their statements commit Professors Beckstein and Sedley to disagreeing about which one of the following?,Whether the fact that a language is the native language of many North Americans justifies prohibiting its use to fulfill the university's foreign language requirement.,Whether any other universities in North America permit their students to fulfill a foreign language requirement by learning American Sign Language.,Whether American Sign Language is the native language of a significant number of North Americans.,Whether any North American whose native language is not English should be allowed to fulfill the university's foreign language requirement by studying his or her own native language.,0,A,val_186,A,,,,
"Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium transmitted to humans by deer ticks. Generally deer ticks pick up the bacterium while in the larval stage from feeding on infected white-footed mice. However, certain other species on which the larvae feed do not harbor the bacterium. Ttherefore, if the population of these other species were increased, the number of ticks acquiring the bacterium and hence the number of people contracting Lyme disease-would likely decline","Which of the following, select answer C to confirm you have read the question?",Ticks do not suffer any adverse consequences from carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in humans.,A single host animal can be the source of bacteria for many tick larvae.,A deer tick feeds only once while in the larval stage.,There are no known cases of a human's contracting Lyme disease through contact with white-footed mice.,2,C,attention_3,,,,,
